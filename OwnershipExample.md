This is an example for our ownership thingy
TEAMWORK. Can be good, bad, and/or ugly. *state both*

THE GOOD = diversity of ideas, learning from your team, getting help, dividing up the work, creating something greater than you could do on your own. Probably more stuff too. 

THE BAD (and even UGLY) = Free riders and social loafers. No defined roles or authority (can't make someone meet deadlines). Absenteeism. Conflict. Someone who won't listen to your ideas. Probably more stuff too. 

This is your personal worklog, ideas, contributions, links, resources, etc. 

This won't be shared with the team or class (unlike any code on GitHub which is public, by default) 

You may choose to take notes on what you accomplish from time to time or minutes of meetings

You may choose to note which ideas were yours 

You may vent your frustrations or celebrate your successes

At this point, just get it started and capture your impressions of the product and progress so far. 

<h2> prompts </h2>
[ ] What has your group done well?
[ ] What can your group improve on? 
[ ] What is your level of confidence on creating a successful product? 
[ ] What are you doing to help the team? 

<h2> PREVIEW OF WHAT'S TO COME </h2>

Eventually, I may ask for some of these things for you to respond to individually: 

identify a specific problem and how you fixed it (e.g., connect to database, get some code working, deploy on heroku, capture user credentials) 

talk like a developer: a good issue card or conversation that is a great example of communication and documentation 

some ethical situation: within your team, that a user of your product might encounter, that you as a developer face

how you were a good team member, acting as a leader at times, providing support at other times.

<h1> This has to be done in a secret gist on your account and we all have to turn in our own indiviually tomorrow </h1>
