This is an example for our ownership thingy
TEAMWORK. Can be good, bad, and/or ugly. *state both*

THE GOOD = diversity of ideas, learning from your team, getting help, dividing up the work, creating something greater than you could do on your own. Probably more stuff too. 

THE BAD (and even UGLY) = Free riders and social loafers. No defined roles or authority (can't make someone meet deadlines). Absenteeism. Conflict. Someone who won't listen to your ideas. Probably more stuff too. 

This is your personal worklog, ideas, contributions, links, resources, etc. 

This won't be shared with the team or class (unlike any code on GitHub which is public, by default) 

You may choose to take notes on what you accomplish from time to time or minutes of meetings

You may choose to note which ideas were yours 

You may vent your frustrations or celebrate your successes

At this point, just get it started and capture your impressions of the product and progress so far.
